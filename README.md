# readme-generator-09
Creates a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Goal:
The goal was to create a node.js app that uses the inquirer package prompts to customize a README.md file that could be used for future projects.

## Issues:
- I had issues populating the data into a README.md file. Although I utilized many resources in trying to find a solution I could not get it to work.
